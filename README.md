# Crowd-Lending Platform


### Project Title: 
Crowd-Lending Platform

### Project Idea Description:
  We will be developing a web application that is exposed as a PaaS. Two types of users can log in; either as a borrower or a lender. A lender will log in to the application and will invest his principal amount and will be giving the expected rate of Interest and the time of the investment. Similarly, the borrower will be logging in and put a request for a certain amount and the interest rate he is looking for. Our intelligent algorithm, not just match peer to peer for the same criteria but also aggregates the different lender's criteria based on the amounts invested, a period of amount availability and interest rates provided and will show an optimum option for the borrower. It also gives the other available options from which the borrower can choose and go ahead.

### Goal of the project:
  This project is targeted towards the people who are in need of some urgent money and also to the people who are interested in investing the money for the benefit of the interest. (Mutual Benefit for both the Lender and the Borrower.
