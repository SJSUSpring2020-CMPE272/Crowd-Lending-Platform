### Project Title: 
Crowd-Lending Platform

### Project Idea Description:
  We will be developing a web application that is exposed as a PaaS. Two types of users can log in; either as a borrower or a lender. A lender will log in to the application and will invest his principal amount and will be giving the expected rate of Interest and the time of the investment. Similarly, the borrower will be logging in and put a request for a certain amount and the interest rate he is looking for. Our intelligent algorithm, not just match peer to peer for the same criteria but also aggregates the different lender's criteria based on the amounts invested, a period of amount availability and interest rates provided and will show an optimum option for the borrower. It also gives the other available options from which the borrower can choose and go ahead.

### Goal of the project:
  This project is targeted towards the people who are in need of some urgent money and also to the people who are interested in investing the money for the benefit of the interest. (Mutual Benefit for both the Lender and the Borrower.

### Project Title : 
HomeSheph

### Project Idea Description:
This is a Web app or an Android app where an user has the option of ordering a cook who comes to their home and provides the delicious dishes they want at home. With all the ingredients already available at home, The cost of the same dish with the same deliciousness being cooked at home by the same chef as in a restaurant comes down by at least 40 percent, thereby turning it into a cost-efficient idea for relishing various options of cuisines.
For example, If a family of 4 people were to eat Biryani(an Indian dish) at a restaurant, it may cost around 50 USD. If the same dish is being prepared at home by the chef at our own house, It costs around 20 USD for all the ingredients and a considerate amount is given to the Chef, based on the effort and the cuisine. That's a saving of 60 percent for the family. 
### Goal of the Project:
 The goal of the project is to build an app for the users who want to enjoy the deliciousness of the dishes at their home at a cheaper cost than what it costs at the restaurant.
